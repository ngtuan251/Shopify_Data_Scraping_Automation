# Shopify_Data_Scraping_Automation

---

In this project, I utilized `ShopifyAPI` to scrape raw data of all orders from the Shopify store of an Ecommerce company.

Then I manipulated the raw data to the approriate format that the company required.

Finally, I used `GoogleSheetAPI` and `TaskScheduler` to automatically update all orders to Google Sheet daily.
